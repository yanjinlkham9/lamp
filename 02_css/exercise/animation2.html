    <div>"As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me: this is exactly the place I've been looking for all my life. A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere.
         I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists. 
         I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."</div>
